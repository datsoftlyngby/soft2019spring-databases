# Database exam, spring 2019

## Re-exam, Wednesday June 26th
This is an oral exam without project.

At the beginning of the exam, you will draw [one of the exam questions in this list](ExamQuestions.md). You are then expected to start presenting your answer. The examiner can interrupt with questions along the way.

**Schedule and length of the exam.** <br>
This will be announced on Wiseflow.

**Preparation.** <br>
At the exam you can bring your notes. You are allowed to briefly look at your notes after you have drawn a question.

It is encouraged that you bring your computer to allow you to show information that help you explain each question. This could for example be:

* ER diagrams
* non-trivial queries
* query plans

You are also welcome to show a live demo if that is the easiest way to present some information.

## Ordinary exam
The exam is based on your group handing in the gutenberg exam project mentioned below. Deadline and practial information of handin is given below as well.

You enter the oral exam in groups. We set aside 10 min for the group, 15 min per person and 5 min for grading and feedback.

The oral exam should start with the group presenting the project in a few slides. 

Next there are two options that the group will choose from:

1. After presentation all leave and enter one at a time to draw a question and get a grade.
2. After presentation we have a discussion of the design of your solution and its relation to the topics from the class.

I recommend exam form 2. I do not need to be told before the exam, the group can tell when the exam starts if they prefer exam form 1 or 2.

In both exam forms you are given individual grades, based on your project and your oral exam.

### Gutenberg exam project

To attend the exam you must solve and hand-in this project:

* [Gutenberg project](GutenbergProject.md)

To form a group, please just put the same self invented group name next to all group members.
