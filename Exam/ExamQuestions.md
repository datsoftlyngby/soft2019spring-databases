# DB Exam questions

1. Explain the data model of MongoDB, MySQL and neo4j. In particular explain how to convert data from MongoDB to the relational model of MySQL. Give a non-trivial example.
2. Explain the aggregation and grouping constructs in the three databases we have been working with. Give a non-trivial example.
3. Explain what indexing is, what is is useful for, and which kind of data can be indexed in the three databases we have been working with. Give an example.
4. Explain what an query plan is. Give an example from at least two databases. Show how an index is used in an query plan.
5. Explain how the different databases support geospatial operations. Also explain the difference between cartesian coordinates and geographical coordinates. Give a an example in at least two different databases.
6. Explain triggers, views and stored procedures in MySQL. Explain the purpose of each and explain the trade-off between storing business logic in the database instead of in the application code.
7. Explain a non-trivial cypher query, and explain how cypher can be used for refactoring.
8. Explain the facilities in MongoDB for datamanipulaton. In particular give an example which updates the sub-structure of several documents at once.
9. Explain how a b-tree functions, in particular how to look up in one. Explain how the planner can use the properties of the B-tree to make a better plan. Briefly explain what an R-tree is and what it is used for.
10. Give examples of normalization problems that can arise when you convert data from a MongoDB to a relational model.
11. Explain what replication is, give en example of how it can be set up in MySQL and how the same mechanism relate to backup.

Besides these questions, I expect you to be able to say a few words on the following topics should the conversation go there:

* Transactions
* Relational algebra
* Key-value stores (from the first lecture)
* ORM
